                  EXCALIBUR: This sword was crafted by Morlin. It is the legendary blade of King Arthur, believed to
                  possess magical powers or symbolizing the rightful sovereignty of Britain. Its earliest reliably
                  datable appearance is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae.

                  Kratos is a fictional character inspired by Greek mythology and the protagonist of the video game
                  series "God of War." He is known for his rage, ruthless fighting skills, and tragic past. Raised as a
                  ruthless warrior of Sparta, Kratos is betrayed by the gods who killed his family, leading him on a
                  journey of vengeance and, in the process, into a relentless battle with the Olympian Gods. His
                  character gains depth in later installments of the series; confronting his own mistakes and past,
                  Kratos battles the gods of Norse mythology alongside his son, while also learning to control his
                  anger. Kratos, who has become an iconic figure in the video game world for both his physical strength
                  and character development, is considered a symbol of tragedy, redemption, and the struggle of mankind
                  to change their destiny.

                  Mjölnir, In Norse mythology, it is the legendary hammer of Thor, the god of thunder, and is a magical
                  weapon that can only be used by Thor and never disappears when thrown and returns to its
                  owner.;bAlthough its short handle and heavy structure were the result of a skillful mistake made by
                  the dwarves Sindri and Brokkr who forged it, Mjölnir became a symbol that doubled Thor's power and
                  became an unshakeable weapon against his enemies.JustMjölnir, also used as a protective and
                  sanctifying object, held an important place in sacred rituals in Scandinavian societies, from marriage
                  ceremonies to births, and was carried as a talisman around the necks of the Vikings.
